# Egg In The Basket Game

SOFTWARE INCUBATOR, 3rd Project i.e. based on HTML, CSS & JS.

It's basically a single player game in which the player has to pass the egg from one basket to another by protecting it against falling to the ground. Indeed the game tests the concentration and the speed of reflexes as one has to protect the egg falling all around the screen with one basket. Moreover, the score of the player will increase when the egg successfully passes from one basket to another which in parallel will increase the speed of baskets and so the difficulty level is raised.
As soon as the egg falls out of the basket , one life will be decremented and the total lives given will be 5.

Overall, it's a classic fun game which is easy enough for children and challenging enough for adults to enjoy:)
